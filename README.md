# Computer Science Portal (CSP)
CSP provides links to Computer Science learning resources that have been developed by the various Computer Science content development projects. 
The main content development project is the School of Computer Science. This portal features exciting examples of Computer Science learning resources. 
CSP participants who are interested in Computer Science are invited to create and participate in learning projects and learning resources and help organize them by developing this portal.
We're just starting, but we already have some good materials.
The Computer Science Portal serves to provide quick access to everything in the Computer Science category.
